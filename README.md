pocketsphinx
============

A Pocket Sphinx binding for Node.JS, focusing on continuous recognition.

Installing
----------

pocketsphinx requires [CMU's Pocket Sphinx libraries](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/). You can build and install it 
yourself, but I highly recommend just getting it from a package manager. For Mac OSX I highly recommend 
[homebrew](http://brew.sh/). It makes this a snap:

    brew install cmu-pocketsphinx

Usage

Notes
-----

This is still in active development. It has only been tested on Mac OSX 10.9.2 with Pocket Sphinx installed using homebrew.
